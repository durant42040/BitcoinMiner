# Bitcoin Miner
This is a simple program that mines new Bitcoin blocks written in Rust. Currently, the probability that a hash successfully mines a bitcoin is about 1 in $10^{23}$. This program runs approximately 10000 hashes per second, meaning it will take about 1.27 trillion years to mine a Bitcoin on average. The program implements two concurrent operations: a WebSocket client that listens to incoming blocks and the miner. 
## WebSocket
The Websocket Client listens to `wss://ws.blockchain.info/inv` for new blocks. In addition, a ping is sent to the WebSocket server every 30 seconds to keep the connection alive. Once a new block is received, the block is sent to the miner and begins mining.
## Mine
Mining is achieved by concatenating the block version, previous hash, merkle root, time, bits(target), and nonce into the block header and performing a double hash. The nonce can be generated by an RNG or incremented at every iteration. All numbers are represented in hexadecimal little-endian form.
